/* 
 * Factorial of a Number : Iterative and Recursive

Problem Statement: Given a number X,  print its factorial.

To obtain the factorial of a number, it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it. More precisely X! = X*(X-1)*(X-2) â€¦ 1.

Note: X  is always a positive number. 

Examples
Example 1:
Input: X = 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1

Example 2:
Input: X = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 3!=3*2*1
